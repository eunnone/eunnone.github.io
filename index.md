# 안녕하세요! Welcome!

Learning Korean has been an exciting journey for me, and leveraging the right tools and resources has made it not only manageable but also enjoyable. Here’s how I’ve organized my study process to maximize efficiency and retention.

Completing Yensoi's First Step Korean
I completed Yensoi’s First Step Korean course within the first week of my studies. It provided a quick yet comprehensive introduction tothe Korean alphabet (Hangul), basic vocabulary, and sentence structures. This was an ideal starting point, as it built my confidence to tackle more complex resources.

Anki for Vocabulary Building
I started with a 500-word TTMIK deck, which provided me with a solid foundation of essential Korean vocabulary. This deck came with audio, making it easier to associate the correct pronunciation with each word. I personalized the deck by adding sentences with audio for contextual learning and updated some of the content to suit my needs.

After mastering the basics, I moved on to the Korean 5K deck, which included words paired with audio and pictures. The images were particularly helpful for creating strong associations between words and their meanings. This visual element significantly improved my retention, as it connected abstract terms to concrete imagery.

How Images Enhance Memory
Using pictures in Anki transformed the way I learned. For example, seeing an image of a traditional Korean dish while studying the word for it helped cement the connection in my mind. This method works because our brains are naturally better at remembering visuals than isolated text.

Watching YouTube with Language Reactor
Language Reactor has been a game-changer for watching Korean content on YouTube. This extension allows me to see Korean subtitles alongside English translations, providing immediate context. It’s particularly helpful for picking up nuances, such as how certain phrases are used in casual conversation versus formal settings. Watching native content with subtitles enhances listening comprehension and introduces cultural elements in a natural way.

Grammar Resources
Grammar is the backbone of any language, and I relied on several beginner-friendly resources to build my understanding:

Sejong Conversation Books: These books emphasize practical dialogue, allowing me to practice phrases I might use in real-life situations. The structured approach helped solidify sentence-building basics.

Korean Grammar in Use (Beginner): This book provides clear explanations and plenty of example sentences. It’s great for understanding foundational grammar points and their applications.

Billy Go’s Beginner Grammar Series: Billy’s videos and materials break down complex grammar points into digestible lessons. His explanations are detailed yet easy to follow, making them an excellent resource for self-learners.
